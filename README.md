# TheOrangeAlliance

[The Orange Alliance](http://theorangealliance.org) is a single page web application (SPA) as well as a public REST API. It was inspired by [The Blue Alliance](http://thebluealliance.com), but we're not affiliated.

This project includes the front-end module of a full-stack web application. For further help on using Angular 6, check out their documentation [here.](https://angular.io/docs)
