      The Orange Alliance (TOA) supports live FTC events reporting team lists, match schedules, qualification match results, alliance selections, and elimination round results. This is accomplished by running the TOA DataSync uploader program in the background on the scoring system computer.<br><br>
	  	  
	  If you are an FTC affiliate partner and want to report live event results, please do the following:<br><br>
	  <ol>
	  <li>
		<b>Request a TOA Event Write Key</b> for your event by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6V7oj_lpfaTdgjUCrBg8P-ggnC_eh0vF6b01sMr9AOjF7_g/viewform">this google form</a>. Please do this at least a few days in advance of your event if possible. You will receive an email with your Event ID and Event API Write Key.<br><br>
	  </li>
	  <li>
